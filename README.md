# House-price-prediction-model
Python program using the scikit-learn library to create a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its square footage
This code defines the training data as a list of square footage values (X_train) and their corresponding house prices (y_train). It then creates a linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library.
The model is trained on the training data using the fit method, and then used to predict the price of a 1800 sqft house using the predict method. The predicted price is printed out.
This is a simple example of how machine learning can be used to make predictions based on input data.
